If you want more recent data you will need to:

- Request access to Reddit API: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezNdDNK1-P8mspSbmtC2r86Ee9ZRbC66u929cG2GX0T9UMyw/viewform

- Pull posts from the Reddit API using PRAW and store in a database or a csv file.

- Retrain the model and create a new .pkl file.

You can host the Flask app locally or use another platform like AWS.
