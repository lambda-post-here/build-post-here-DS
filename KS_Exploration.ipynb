Recently, however, I moved into the top floor of a multi-level apartment complex. I'm aware that staying in my apartment is not the safest area and ideally I should get to a ground floor (definitely no basements available in this area). That being the case, I have two options. I can run down to the first floor and see if a neighbor will let me take shelter in their apartment, or I can run to the parking structure next to my apartment. Now I know generally an above ground parking structure is a no-no considering the open air and the many potential vehicle projectiles, but this structure does have an enclosed stairwell at the corner of the building. I could potentially hunker down in the enclosed concrete stairwell rather than a neighbors apartment, and that sounds to my brain like a safer area with all the concrete. But would that actually be safe or is my mind deceiving me? The stairwell is at the outer edge of the structure rather than being in the middle of a building (though it is completely concrete - no windows), so does that compromise its sturdiness? What is my safest bet here?  \\n\\n\\nI'd also like to leave the floor open for anyone else who might have a tornado preparedness question they're curious about. Let's help each other have a safer tornado season!\",\n",

I’d highly recommend canceling any travel or outdoor plans. \\n\\nMake sure to keep your phone on a charger all day to keep your phone at 100%.

There was discussion of a High Risk, but there are “too many modes for failure” per an SPC employee. Here is some noteworthy text from the outlook: \\n\\n“A potential for long-track tornadoes will be possible and a regional outbreak of tornadoes could occur across parts of the moderate risk area.”\\n\\n9:33am: SPC Maintains MDT. Read their newest [PWO](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/pwo.html). \\n\\n“Tornadoes -- some potentially strong to violent (EF2+) -- are possible today from east Texas to central Mississippi.”\\n\\n12:30pm: SPC surprisingly still maintains a Moderate Risk.

       " 'Re-posted and deleted the last because the title was contradictory to the point I was trying to make. \\n\\nFor context- 1. I am a woman. 2. I was a victim of rape. \\n\\nOur justice system in the US is severely corrupted by the movement of womens’ empowerment and the fear of being judged in cases of a W accusing a M of rape. BOTH sides should be investigated heavily. Yes, it is a horrible thing and no, not all W  lie about being raped. YES IT IS RARE. However, M shouldn’t have to live in fear because a one-in-a-million crazy person accuses them of rape just because the M turned them down (or whatever BS circumstance). It’s like putting a hand over the mouth of real justice. \\n\\nWhen my incident happened, I was in a foreign country. Thus, it was headed by their legal system and I was able to compare it with ours in the US. I was treated just as much of a suspect as the actual rapist was, and I highly respected that. It led to a proper, thorough, and fair investigation and an accurate one, at that. I came foreword with it 2+ years after it happened, with no medical/DNA evidence whatsoever. \\n\\nThis, IMHO, also causes M to be taken less seriously in the courtroom when and if they ever take THEIR rapist/assaulter to court and the accused happens to be a W- resulting in less M reporting as victims. It is especially discouraging to the “why i didn’t report” movement because there is heightened uncertainty of the validity of the case. The investigations of these cases should be improved and it shouldn’t send a cloud over the justice system when they find an innocent person truly innocent, beyond a shadow of a doubt. And if there is doubt, then the investigation should continue until there is absolutely no more doubt on either side. Yes, rape is an incredibly difficult thing to prove. Especially years after the fact. That being said, the dark cloud that hangs over a judges’ and the jury’s heads shouldn’t be due to the fear of being shunned from society and hated on due to the decision of a truly innocent person being found innocent. \\n\\n\\nEdit: this isn’t a “lying about rape is bad and a crime” post. It’s a deeper discussion on the social stigma regarding the higher support for W who are accusing a M of assault, resulting in a sub-par investigation due to the fear of being reprimanded for finding the accused anything other than guilty.\\n\\nEdit 2: I’m all for feminism and empowering my own gender FFS. It’s the hyper-empowerment double standard that wants equal respect but not equal anything else that I have a problem with.\\n\\nEdit 3: Edited all “male” “men” “women” and “female” references to M and W because apparently using terms “women” and “females” interchangeably makes me a man. Jesus Christ\\n\\nEdit 4: alright well i wasn’t going to do this because i didn’t want a picture of myself on a post that involved me admitting to being a victim of rape but here you go boys and girls I’m not a fucking man.

       " 'In fact, it *could* even harm your relationship.\\n\\nDisclaimer: i\\'m not talking about when you cant control it. That just happens sometimes, its no big deal, and if your partner gets mad cos you do it accidentally, thats no good. Please dont at me in the comments saying \"you get mad if someone cant help farting?!\" Because that is NOT what i\\'m saying.\\n\\nWhat i AM saying though, is that there is a strong case to be made for supressing it or doing it in private if and when you can, and that being lazy and  never trying to hide it can negatively affect your relationship.\\n\\nOne more time: i\\'m not talking about ones you cant help.\\n\\nBut if youre like me, often, you know. 90 times out of 100, i can feel if i need to fart.  When i get that feeling, if my bf is in the same room, i\\'ll get up and go to the bathroom or another room where he cant hear me, do it, and come back.\\n\\nWhy? Because (and this is all personal opinion, ymmv), farts are gross. If i have something stuck in my teeth i dont grimace and dig at it with a fingernail in front of my bf. I dont clip my toenails in front of him. And i dont fart in front of him (except, like i said, when i cNt help it). Its important to note that he\\'s an amazing guy and would never make me feel bad if i did.. but thats not a good enough reason to do it. In fact, its kind of taking advantage of his kindness.\\n\\nYou know that energy you get in a new relationship, that spark of excitement? Its in part due to the unknown. The mystery. Burping, farting, picking at your face ect, all take away from that mystery, and so they take away from that spark and excitement between couples. The vast majority of people are not attracted to family members, even when they look like Brad Pitt or Halle Berry. Why? I think in part because when you live/grow up with someone, all the mystery is gone. You e seen then slumped over the toilet puking, youve seen them fart, you see all the behind the scenes stuff.. and that removes arousal.\\n\\nThe same happens in relationships. Ever notice how no matter how much you love someone, after a few years together a lot of times the sex goes downhill? People are always so baffled by this. Why dont i find him/her sexy anymore? I still love them :/, but in many cases its just because one or both partners stops actively trying to be sexy for the other. We act like sexual attraction isnt something that needs to be nurtured just like love and friendship do, but it does-and one way to do it is to keep caring how you come off to eachother.\\n\\nIt takes almost no effort for me to simply get up, go to another room, fart, and come back. Unless youre disabled over very overweight, anyone can do it. Its not hard. I dont do it because i feel i hav e to. I am not \"afraid\" i\\'ll turn him off. Rather, its more that i actively still want to turn him on. And no, its not obvious. Ill go get a drink, go pee, ect. I dont fart that much so its not like im randomly getting up every hour.\\n\\nI love our sex life. 5 years in i still get butterflies sometimes when he looks in my eyes. I\\'m still WILDLY attracted to him. Sex is very important to both of us, so i keep myself looking good in every way i can, i leave the room to fart if i can. I\\'ll do little burps in front of him once in a while, but not alot, and never big ones. I dont clip nails in front of him or pop pimples. Before he gets home from work i often make sure im dressed cute and freshen my makeup. I feel obligated to do NONE of this. Its done happily, out of love, and with a desire to always keep that bit of mystery that makes things a little extra special.\\n\\nI dont have to\\nHes never told me to\\nI WANT to\\nI do so happily\\n\\nIts not just for him, its for me, too. I love feeling sexy and attractive.\\n\\nI just always see peole say, especially in threads here, stuff like, \"i knew it was real when we had a farting contest\". That might be all good now, and it might always be good.. or in a few years you might see eachother as roomates, nothing more, because neither if you gave the other the respect of making an effort to be desireable. Love shouldnt mean \"ok now i never have to think about being sexy or attractive to you ever again\".\\n\\nIn conclusion-i realize this is a super unpopular opinion. The one time, years ago, i dared voice it, i was roundly criticized as being \"scared to open up to my man\". But to me opening up isnt burping and farting, its talking and being honest, and my bf and i do a lot of that. I feel safe with him.\\n\\nBut i also feel sexy and wanted by him, and vice versa, because we nurture our sexual attraction for eachother, and dont replace it with \"who can fart loudest\" contests.\\n\\nTL;DR: i make an effort to be sexy for my man and that includes not burping or farting (when i can help it) or doing any other off-putting things while he\\'s around. He doesnt make me, i dont do it out of fear-i do it happily because it enhances our relationship.',\n",

       " 'Just as the title says. And I\\'ll explain. I have had a PS4 and Nintendo Switch since late 2017. And had the Xbox One day 1 in 2013 plus a One S I got about 5 months ago. So I come with this as someone who has been with Xbox way longer and has a much bigger attachment to it. \\n\\nLet\\'s start with exclusives. Xbox has jack shit. I love Halo, but even recent games in that big franchise have released buggy, unfinished and full of microtransactions. This applies to tons of their exclusives. Only thing else they have is Gears of War which has hardly evolved at all and Forza which I guess if you just love racers yippee. Compare this to the nonstop barrage of exclusives from tons of genres and franchises for Nintendo and Sony. Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, Kirby, Smash Bros, Metroid, Kid Icarus, Fire Emblem, Animal Crossing, F-Zero, Pikmin, plus the ton of sub franchises like Mario Kart for Nintendo. Sony has Uncharted, The Last of Us, Ratchet and Clank, Bloodborne, Infamous, Spider-Man, Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, Persona 5, etc. I think this point is clear. Xbox relies so much on third parties from Ubisoft, EA and Activision who have all gone to shit anyway at this point meaning they only rarely get those awesome polished games to play on the platform. \\n\\nThen the way the console runs. I mean it when I say on both Switch and PS4 I have had minimal issues with the consoles at all. I really can\\'t recall even any small problems right now. The Xbox is a nonstop barrage of shit, and you could argue it\\'s having a day 1 Xbox, but it\\'s debunked when I mention my One S I recently got carried all the same issues. The UI is insanely cluttered and also laggy. It\\'s very frequent it doesn\\'t even fucking catch up with my inputs. It takes forever to get from one menu to another. Or load everything in on my ready to install list. It very frequently will just fucking freeze up on the Xbox Store for 10 seconds on a screen. And don\\'t get me started on those system updates. It\\'s a 3 step process that takes forever and I swear to got the Switch and PS4 take half as long and usually even update in the BACKGROUND. I had an issue the other day where my console just wouldn\\'t load my games and tell me it took too long to start for everything. Which took a soft restart followed by a hard restart to fix. \\n\\nOnline. You hear all this great stuff about Xbox Live, but truthfully it\\'s the shittiest online experience I\\'ve ever witnessed. For the last year XBL has been pretty much unplayable for me. I\\'m not kidding. \"well it\\'s your WiFi\". Sadly it\\'s just not. My PS4 and Switch again have had 0 issues online. In fact I ran a test. I was trying to play Halo with my buddy and I was lagging uncontrollably and he thought it was my internet. He gets bothered how much I shit on Xbox so I ran a test to prove my rightful reasoning. I literally pulled out my Switch and played a successful online match of Mario Kart with 0 lag as I was lagging in Halo. It\\'s clearly the Xbox. And keep in mind again this is across two Xboxes. \\n\\nI think I\\'ve made my point. I believe the Xbox is a complete piece of shit console and I probably haven\\'t even covered half the issues I\\'ve encountered. And I know this may seem baseless without proof so I figured I would drop my gamertag here. It is inFINN1te. I wanted to provide it so those of you who doubt me can see how long I\\'ve played on Xbox and payed for Xbox Live and the insane amount of gamerscore I have. I speak from a ton of experience. I truly that the Xbox One is a complete piece of shit platform.\\n\\nEdit: I want to add one last thing. This isn\\'t me just trying to fuel a console war. I\\'m just saying I think as a device and from my experience with Xbox, it\\'s a garbage product. I buy all consoles and have no bias. And if I did have a bias, it would probably be in favor of Xbox due to my long history with it.',\n",

Going off the Democracy Ranking, it's ranked [30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index), and is classified as a flawed democracy. \\n\\nFlawed democracies are nations where elections are fair and free and basic civil liberties are honored but may have issues (e.g. media freedom infringement). These nations have significant faults in other democratic aspects, including underdeveloped political culture, low levels of participation in politics, and issues in the functioning of governance. For reference, South Korea, Japan, France, the US, Belgium, and many more countries are ranked as flawed democracies.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnyways, here are the freedom rankings for the rest of the Middle East:\\n\\n1. Egypt: 127, Authoritarian\\n2. Iran: 150, Authoritarian\\n3. Iraq: 114, Hybrid Regime bordering on Authoritarian\\n4. Turkey: 110, Hybrid Regime\\n5. Jordan: 115, Authoritarian\\n6. UAE: 147, Authoritarian\\n7. Syria: 166, Authoritarian ( Only North Korea is more Authoritarian )\\n8. Saudi Arabia: 159, Authoritarian\\n9. Yemen: 158, Authoritarian\\n10. Qatar: 133, Authoritarian\\n11. Bahrain: 148, Authoritarian\\n12. Lebanon: 106, Hybrid Regime \\n13. Kuwait: 116, Authoritarian\\n14. Oman: 140, Authoritarian\\n15. Palestine: 109, Hybrid Regime ( Palestine didn't show up on the HDI index website, which is why it wasn't mentioned before )\\n\\nAs you can see, every other Middle Eastern country is either Authoritarian or a hybrid regime ( most of which are heavily authoritarian, like Turkey ). If you compare that to Isreal, it's no wonder why people call Isreal the only functioning democracy in the Middle East. Compared to other Middle Eastern countries, it's a paragon of democracy.\\n\\nTLDR: Isreal has better standards of living and freedom that the rest of the Middle East\\n\\nPS:\\n\\nFinally, before I go, I'd like to address a particular comment that I got on my last post. The comment stated that Isreal:\\n\\nA) Has killed more Palestinians than vice-versa ( True )\\n\\nB) Is a terrorist organization ( Not true )\\n\\nTo address the first point, the lopsided casualties are due to a disparity in technology. Obviously, the side with better tech is going to have an advantage over its foes. You can see a similar situation if you look at the casualty count for the Vietnam War, where Americans killed more Vietnamese than vice-versa. Anyways, casualty counts don't determine who is right or wrong in a war. \\n\\nAs to address the second point, the person linked an r/Palestine post as his source for that claim. I'm sorry, but r/Palestine is one of the worst sources you could use in a debate like this. It's heavily biased, and Reddit isn't that reliable of a source anyways. It would be like using statistics compiled by r/The_Donald ( don't click ) to disprove climate change.\",\n",

Though the word \"let\" was used.)  \\n\\n\\nAnyway, it made me sad. It made me sad to see women in the comments trying to stick up for themselves and say \"hey, I should be allowed to post whatever i\\'d like!!\" but then sheepishly adding \"i\\'m not doing it for attention tho\" at the end. Girl. It\\'s ok if you\\'re doing it for attention. **It\\'s ok.**   \\n\\n\\nIt is normal and healthy to like and want attention. It is normal and healthy for both sexes. Women are by far demonized for it more, so that\\'s the reason i\\'m going to focus on them a little more in this post, but I do want to make clear that it\\'s ok for both sexes. Got it? good.  \\n\\n\\nSo I mentioned there were a lot of scary comments on yesterdays post... i\\'ll admit that\\'s subjective based on who you are reading it, but I know I can\\'t be alone in this thinking. I am sure there are other women (and a few men) who read some of those comments and just thought.... holy. shit. I\\'m referring to the many, many, many slut-shaming comments,  as well the ones about how \"when a woman in a relationship posts a sexy photo, other men are sniggering behing their hands at the man who\\'s woman \"did that to him\"\" .... as if there aren\\'t A) many men who are secure enough in themselves and their relationship to not care what their partner posts and B) Many types of relationships and relationship dynamics, not all that include monogamy. I saw comments about how a certain man doesn\\'t mind sexy photos, but would never let HIS woman do that, \\\\*gasp\\\\*. Then, we had some that crossed the line to the point I worry there\\'s actual abuse happening in the relationships of the men who posted them. But honestly, if I were just to sit here and address the comments on that post, we\\'d be here all day.  \\n\\n\\nWhat I want to say to the women of reddit (and the men, but like I said, we\\'re focusing on the women here as they\\'re the ones who were attacked yesterday and the ones normally demonized for this) is that IT IS OK TO LIKE ATTENTION. It is OK to leave the salon with a new haircut and be feeling yourself and walk with a spring in your step and hope people notice. It is OK to post a photo at the gym of your hard worked-on body and want people to NOTICE YOU. It is OK if I post a photo of myself in a bikini and, because my breasts and behind are large and i\\'m a tiny woman, they\\'re noticeable by default and I don\\'t fucking mind that and also don\\'t mind the attention.   \\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to add \"I don\\'t do it for the attention\" as an afterthought on your posts. I mean, let\\'s be real, what is social media for?? It\\'s purpose is literally to get attention for yourself and your life.   \\n\\n\\nI get that women have breasts and men don\\'t. But I don\\'t get that a lot of the critism of \"sexy\" pics, or even the criteria for a \"sexy\" pic, involves how prominent a womens ass is in the photos. It\\'s weird that we\\'ve sexualized women\\'s asses and not mens. Do you know how many gym rat (not using this as a derogatory term) guys I have on IG? Sooooo, sooo many. All of them post photos of themselves shirtless and flexing. Selfies of themselves posing for the camera. Feeling themselves. And no one bats an eye. No one tells these men that they have GIRLFRIENDS and WIVES damn it, and that their body is ONLY for THEIR WOMEN, and are they posting these photos for \\\\*big gasp\\\\* ATTTENTION?????? No one does that. No one treats these men like they are men of lesser virtue. Women don\\'t have that same luxury.   \\n\\n\\nSome women get shit when the photos aren\\'t even sexy. For example: I am a skinny woman. I am a short woman. I have very large breasts. I can wear a low cut T-shirt and sometimes look like i\\'m headed off to a playboy shoot. It\\'s just the way i\\'m built. But if it\\'s hot outside, damn it, i\\'m wearing the T shirt. Or a tank top. And if I feel the need to post a photo of myself that day at lunch with my friends, and my tits look big and prominent, it\\'s because they are big and prominent. That\\'s just reality. It\\'s also reality that a few years ago I posted a photo like this and was told by a family member I should \"take it down\" because \"what will people think\" and \"how embarrassing for \\\\*my boyfriends name\\\\*\" (I can tell you this family member was blocked immediately when my IG started to be monitized about a year later, because life as a social media influencer would not have been \"acceptable\" in her case and I didn\\'t want to hear the bitching). My boyfriend, who she was so worried would be \"offended\" that HIS woman had DARE post a photo where OTHER MEN can tell she HAS BREASTS??? He was at an adult nude beach that day and posted a photo of himself, drunk and naked, holding a beer can over his manhood. Not one person expressed outrage at that photo. Not one. Not one person told him that his body is only for ME, his WOMAN, and is he TRYING to get attention from OTHER WOMEN?? Everyone just treated it like it was a funny photo from a fun vacation of a very drunk man.  \\n\\n\\nI\\'ve been very fortunate to have men in my life who haven\\'t minded one lick whether I posted a \"sexy\" photo or not. I read comments yesterday (I know, I know, last time I reference them I swear) that would have me believe all my boyfriends were actually \"dying inside\" everytime I posted a photo like that and just didn\\'t have \"the balls\" to tell me. I can assure you, balls were not something a single one of those men lacked. They were just men who loved me, who trust me, were mature and secure in our relationship. So when I posted a photo a few weeks back of both my long hair (which i\\'m proud of) and my ass (which i\\'m also proud of, dammit), i know this is taboo to say \\\\*eye roll\\\\*, for  a t t e n t i o n, you know what my boyfriend did? went back to playing video games. You know what he\\'s done once or twice in the past with similar photos? reposted them on his IG as his \"WCW\". Because I LIKE ATTENTION. I like it and that\\'s ok. I like it and it doesn\\'t mean i\\'m going to cheat on my boyfriend. I like it and HE doesn\\'t have to be offended by that because some men are.   \\n\\n\\nLadies, just.... don\\'t let anyone tell you what you should and shouldn\\'t be proud of. Don\\'t let anyone tell you you can\\'t like attention. I saw so many women yesterday desperately trying to explain that in their relationship they have trust, and therefore their S.O doesn\\'t care what they post, only to be smacked down and told that\\'s impossible. He\\'s a man, so he MUST care. It\\'s definitely not possible that there are all types of adult relationships, like my friend who is a happily married stripper who\\'s husband helps promote her premium snapchat.  \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s ok for grown adults who aren\\'t hurting anyone to like attention, and you cannot convince me otherwise.  \\n\\n\\n\\\\*deep breath\\\\* ..post',\n",

If I need to get my phone calls recorded in order to know that somewhere out there, British intelligence is using the same procedures to nail terrorist cells, or prevent a murder, then I'd call that a necessary evil. I'd even call that a win. After all, I have nothing really to hide. My phone calls are rare, and typically boring, or cold calls.\\n\\nI don't care if somebody out there knows how much time I spend on Reddit, or Youtube, but if the same technology can be used to determine whether a radicalised teen is trying to build a bomb, then I'd be okay with that. I'd even call that a win. My porn tastes are pretty normal, I don't spew hate speech or abuse or anything like that. I don't break laws, there's nothing incriminating in my e-mails or my Facebook messages or my Twitter feed. I understand there are people out there who obviously don't want to be watched this closely, but the fact of the matter is, there are a lot of people who NEED to be watched this closely, and without that surveillance, how many needless crimes are committed? How many people are hurt? Lives ruined?\\n\\nSecondly, I'm a firm believer that social media usage needs to be policed, or at least social media providers should do more to police their users. I watched a TED talk a while back about a woman who made a joke (an honest joke, perhaps in poor taste, but a joke all the same), she boarded a flight to Australia, disembarked later and found that this one innocent but ill-advised joke had utterly ruined her. I can't remember the exact results, but she's not the only example.\\n\\nSocial media, specifically Twitter, has the power to literally ruin lives. That's disgusting to me. That anonymity is so dangerous, so toxic. There needs to be some accountability, some consequences. I'm not talking about censorship. Let people talk about whatever they want, but make sure they understand that there are consequences. Freedom of speech does not mean freedom to stir hatred. It does not mean you can wantonly slur and slander, abuse and assault whoever the hell you want without fear of reprisals. We are a civilised culture (more or less), there are laws that we all should abide by which, despite some contrarian logic I suppose, are ultimately designed to keep us all safe and healthy. Yes, these systems are flawed, but we all rely on them.\\n\\nLike it or not, the world does not just function offline anymore, and the internet is perfectly capable of creating havoc and causing needless pain. How many extremists recruit over Facebook, or Twitter? There's recently been drama about the content getting through on YouTube, including the video recorded by the NZ shooter. Things like that should not be possible. So yeah, spy on my internet history, listen to my calls, track my location, whatever. \\n\\nEDIT: I elaborated a bit in the comments, since fair points were raised which I had considered but not discussed.\",\n",

Then on my second road trip I realized I couldn't check off that I had experienced Michigan, and just to drive into the city, look around a little, then leave so at least I can say I've been to Michigan. \\n\\nBut now I'm in the city and it's incredible. Yeah I can see what they're talking about with regard to depression, but you can sense the potential, it's like a field ashes with the flowers pushing through to the surface. All the big name brands are here, including a giant Google corporate office, and to me Detroit is way cooler than what I saw in Chicago, a city which never experienced a reputation hit like Detroit, and while I don't plan on relocating to either city, if I were to choose between the two, I'd honestly choose Detroit because the scene here is hip and you can feel it hasn't even peaked yet.\",\n",

The battles in the OJ feels to much like a battle in Yu-Gi-Oh, since both players use cards to battle. If I wanted to see people in an anime use cards, I would just watch Yu-Gi-Oh. The newer battles are more action packed and exciting. Yes, there is more development in the OJ, but it’s unfair to talk down on Battle Planet for having less development than the OJ, even though the OJ has over 100+ episodes and Battle Planet has only  22 at the moment. I do agree though that sometimes Battle Planet can be a bit cringy. The team name being called “The Awesome Ones” was very cringy after a while, but I got over it.

Importantly, this includes guidance counselors and other staff who don’t have classes (0 students for these teachers), so the real average would go from about 27 to 35 students. \\n\\nAll this is being done in an effort to reduce spending, due to the deficit/spending problem in Ontario. I am not arguing my opinion on this policy, but the teachers in my school have repeatedly said that an increase in class size would worsen the education system and this led to a student and teacher walkout a few weeks ago. I think that if we decreased class sizes and hired better teachers (for high schools), this would create a more effective education system.\\n\\nActual Argument: Obviously I don’t think we improve the education system by cutting spending, but I do think that bigger class sizes is actually a good solution. During my high school career so far (am in grade 11), the best class I have been in is a physics class that had over 35 people in it. While the room was constantly packed, and the teacher had less time to talk individually with someone, he was by far the best teacher I have ever had, because he was so qualified and knowledgeable in this area.\\n\\nWhile there have been studies showing that decreasing class sizes improves test scores, these studies only examined increasing funding to hire more teachers, and not actually paying teachers less on average in order to hire more overall. “A study in Israel, the finding was that there was no significant relationship between class size and achievement. A 2011 study in the United States turned out similar findings, and a key reason was that with smaller classes, many new, inexperienced teachers were hired, and they have yet to be effective in classrooms.\"\\n\\nWhile I do firmly believe in this opinion, I am by no means an expert in public education and am open to having my mind changed. \\n\\nSources: https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/moe-cautious-issue-smaller-class-sizes-ong-ye-kung\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_rankings_of_Singapore\\nhttps://www.mississauga.com/news-story/9282647-peel-s-educational-support-workers-protest-ford-government-s-radical-cuts-to-education/',\n",

One minute they're walking along peering on every tree they see, next minute they spot another dog across the road and without warning, run over to it.

The last thing they want is to be walking down the street and see an off lead dog bounding down towards them. Secondly, sometimes dogs don't do that well with other dogs. The owner of that dog should be able to walk their dog knowing it won't have to deal with stray dogs coming over. \\n\\nIf you want your dog to have a big run around, take it to a nice big open area where there aren't people or cars. \\n\\nNote: Obviously off lead dog parks don't count \\n\\nNote 2: I'm a dog person, I love them, I currently have a dog and I've had dogs all my life.\",\n",

I guess this example comes off especially misogynistic  because men are usually associated with tools.\\n\\nLook in to it and you’ll see a few reasons.\\n\\n1) Yes, men buy more tools, and not the pink kind. Which means pink tools have a smaller market which means lower demand therefore lower supply and the less you mass produce of something the more expensive that thing will typically cost.\\n\\n2) Pink as a color is more difficult to create through dyes requiring more inputs to the process to create more of a novelty product that fewer people are going to buy.\\n\\n3) look at clothes. First of all, the argument that the “same white t shirt costs less for men” is false. Typically a white gilden or Hanes shirt is fucking unisex. My girlfriend wears my shirts all the time, and in fact we went shipping today and she bought a small men’s shirt which cost $30, same as the women’s shirts.

Spoilers down below if you care and somehow haven\\'t seen the show past season 3\\n\\nSo basically the concept of the show just kind of sucks in general if you ask me. This is subjective but whatever I wanna express my opinion. I\\'ll get to the objective shit later.\\n\\nIt\\'s just a big melodrama that happens to have animal people thrown into the mix. Nothing spectacular really happens and it relies really heavily on manufactured drama. It\\'s boring as hell really. Rick and Morty\\'s appeal is all of the crazy sci-fi shit and the fact you have NO idea where they could go with it. Trailer Park Boy\\'s appeal is character interaction and seeing how they try to make money or just generally live. Bojack Horseman? \\n\\nWell.... the characters whine about their problems a lot... sometimes they interact and its engaging and funny... then they set up situations that seem interesting at first then fall flat entirely like it didn\\'t happen... and then its just depressing shit after depressing shit. sometimes there\\'s an animal pun or theres 3 kids in a trenchcoat. maybe someone like Todd says something stupid. that\\'s the only levity you\\'ll get from the show. some lines of dialogue are funny... but sometimes it\\'s really confusing. Like one time Bojack teases a little girl actor that they\\'ll have a great day doing Disneyland esque shit, then turns around says \"haha fuck you idiot JK\" then leaves. That\\'s honestly hilarious, but if you want me to feel sympathetic for Bojack later on, well no chance there.\\n\\nBut I couldn\\'t care less about the characters, but what makes the show BAD are the shitty, boring, convenient solutions to problems they constantly write themselves out of\\n\\nBojack doesnt face any real reprecussions for what he does. There was a Rock Opera early on in Season 1, basically Bojack reluctantly helps Todd create a rock opera that becomes a big hit for critics, but then Bojack gets sad because Todd suggests moving out finally because Bojack (on the surface) doesn\\'t like him. There was a video game Todd was talking about earlier on that he was addicted to and completely ruined him, So then Bojack goes out of his way to buy a brand new game, get some actors, stage a really convoluted way to get Todd to buy the game and get him addicted so he can\\'t do the Rock opera.\\n\\nThat seems pretty interesting as a setup right?\\n\\nEvery single second they spent building that up was wasted. Afterwards Todd *pretty much* forgives him, says \"you\\'re a dick but i expect that so its ok\" and then they never bring it up again. It was all pointless. All that buildup was basically for nothing, It may as well never happened. Maybe it\\'ll come up again later in like season 7 or whatever... but anyone like me who gave up early on in the show doesn\\'t give a shit. you fire off that load NOW when you CAN so you keep people\\'s interest.\\n\\nIf they have Todd slowly build up noticable resentment towards Bojack after the event, I\\'d give them that... but they don\\'t do that. He stays exactly the same. So it may as well have never happened. it was pointless.\\n\\nSame thing with the pigeons, some pigeons take pictures of him fucking the child actor he teased (when she is of age mind you) and blackmail Bojack with it. They build it up like having the pigeons call him in the middle of an episode and he thinks its a joke and hangs up, etc. Subtle hints. Slowly building up to an apex...\\n\\nThen they drop it in an episode later. The pigeons directly go to his agent and make the threat. Shit is **GOING DOWN!!!**\\n\\nBut that same episode there\\'s conveniently some random lady we never see again who comes in and solves the problem entirely within a single scene. She makes some threats and they run away with their tails between their legs. What the fuck? What was that?\\n\\nIt may as well have never happened then. Every single second they spent building that up was wasted. It was all a complete waste of time. Great. I was excited too.\\n\\nSame thing with Secretariat, Bojack signs up for his dream movie he always wanted to be in, some drama or whatever happens I don\\'t remember, he ditches it all and moves to New Mexico in a boat with his old friend.\\n\\nThe only ONLY consequence in that ENTIRE show that they get right is when Bojack tries fucking his friend\\'s daughter. He ruined his friendship irredeemably with her. She never wants to see him again. Those are real fucking consequences. They\\'re not pointless in the end and they are emotionally satisfying to watch. This is how the show should be written. Serious fucking consequences for Serious fucking problems.\\n\\nAnd then he goes back to Secretariat, where they say \"maybe you broke contract and wasted millions of dollars and a ton of people\\'s time where realistically a ton of people would be angry and you would be in a fuckton of lawsuits, but it\\'s all ok because we just CGIed you into the movie and no hard feelings.\" Now we\\'re straight back to no-consequence ville.\\n\\nThat\\'s what I hate most about the show. In the end I really don\\'t give a shit how poorly developed the characters are, the point is they constantly do shit like this where they build up a problem, then it falls flat and nothing happens as a result. This makes me not want to watch the show at all. I spend time getting emotionally invested only for it to not go ANYWHERE. **MULTIPLE TIMES!!!**\\n\\nI can even fix the writing too. Todd leaves Bojack entirely because he fucked with him big time. You see him more angry about it then anything that\\'s ever bothered him in the show because he got cheated and betrayed by someone who pushed him to succeed with his dreams. That\\'s something that would fuck with you a lot. Maybe he does stuff with Mr. Peanut Butter so he stays relevant in the show. Who knows. Maybe Todd can even forgive Bojack later for all I care, what\\'s important is that there\\'s a serious hefty consequence for what Bojack did. he ruined his friendship with Todd entirely because he was so desperate to keep it.\\n\\nMake it so the blackmail pigeons scare Bojack enough to run away from the movie entirely, when he gets back his acting career is over from all the rumors and news and hes practically going bankrupt over the lawsuits from running away, and he has to shamble getting his life together when he\\'s at the lowest he\\'s ever been and desperate for some place to turn to after he\\'s already been rejected and run off by his single remaining ex-friend in New Mexico. There you go. Consequences for his actions, and also a way more engaging scenario for Bojack to be in.\\n\\nThat\\'s literally the lowest he could possibly be. At that point you want to SEE how he\\'d get himself out of this shitty situation he created. Like maybe for a short while he can turn to Mr. Peanut Butter for help and have to live under his roof as a leech. That\\'d be funny seeing Bojack unimaginably lower than Mr. Peanut Butter... who Bojack always thought he was better than. I wonder what kinda interactions would spring from that.\\n\\nYou can literally write the show in a trillion different ways if you wanted to. If I can do it, should be fair to put that expectation on the writers who get paid for it. Too bad the fans don\\'t. If you go on Bojack\\'s subreddit or look it up on google, its just endless praise, always bringing up really trite and vague stuff like \"it depicts mental illness well\" or something, but never anything meaningful. its always the same broken record. Practically every good review for Bojack says the same shit. People like the show because it is sad because of mental illnesses, and sometimes it\\'s funny. That is literally the appeal for the show as far as I looked into it. That\\'s barely even summarizing, too. No breakdowns, no proper analyzing, if they do analyze, its usually them looking into the show **way** too deep and bringing in way more concepts and ideas than the show ever intentionally put forward (the whole \"the author said the curtains were blue, teacher overanalyzes the shit out of it, author just meant blue curtains\" kind of idea), but usually a majority of them are very surface level shit that boils down to \"it is good because they wrote conflict\"\\n\\nIts like bronies drumming up bullshit excuses why my little pony is a great show, but at least Bojack fans are not as embarrassing and full of shit... but it feels like a similar situation. basically people having buyers remorse... but in this case it\\'s time and emotional remorse with a TV show\\n\\nin the end the show is alright... mediocre to me really. but i get mad seeing people constantly praise it when there\\'s GLARING issues nobody ever talks about. I can\\'t even say the show is good if you compare it to something like TPB, which is way more funny, engaging, and well written than Bojack\\'s ever been, albiet they are two completely different shows... I mean Bojack doesn\\'t even compare to really any show I can think of... I\\'d probably compare it more to Hallmark shows or Riverdale or something... except it has a nice coat of animation and funny animal characters going for it, that\\'s why it just seems so different from that type of show.\\n\\ntl;dr >!eat shit idiot why dont you read for once in your life!<',\n",

Like a lot of things taste good with that much caramel drizzle and that many spoons of sugar. Also its advocates are always constantly talking about how much they need it and can't function without it. Get a grip. You were born without it and you can sure as hell thrive without it. I will concede that the smell is pretty nice in the air as its brewed, but not when it is coming out of someone's breath.  \\n\\nGo ahead and keep drinking. But hot cocoa over coffee any day.\",\n",

My husband and I are celebrating ten years this summer while none of my bridesmaids have yet to wed (although one will in the fall).

We didn\\'t feel pressured to have a huge wedding.  People knew we were young and didn\\'t have the cash so blowing thousands upon thousands wasn\\'t in the picture.

It was really nice to enjoy so many years of married life before the hard part started (marriage is a piece of cake compared to child-rearing,and I have a fairly easy kid).\\n3. We bought our first place together.  It was just really awesome that we had the experience of getting our first apartment and later house with each other.\\n4. I found getting started in my career stressful and so did my husband.  It provided a lot of comfort to us knowing that we had each other to lean on.  \\n5. Less baggage.  Both of us only had one ex.  We didn\\'t have kids from other partners.  We had no debt besides some small student loan debt my husband carried for a few years.  We didn\\'t even bring pets into the marriage.

       " \"Here are just a few reasons:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1. Our minds and bodies are perfectly suited to be a hunter gatherer. Civilization has caused so many health and psychological problems, such as heart disease, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, epithelial cell cancers, autoimmune disease, osteoporosis, 98% of the population has tooth decay, acne, loneliness, anxiety, depression which are rare or virtually absent in hunter–gatherers and other non-westernized populations. I will provide sources for this claim if requested. Nature did not give us the tools to be able to resist these unhealthy foods and terrible lifestyles, so people will only continue to become fatter, sicker, and more lonely than we already are.\\n2. Modern day working life is in general terrible for most people. According to survey data most Americans hate their jobs. We weren't designed to have to be forcefully woken up by an alarm and drive to work. We were not designed to have to sit in a building all day doing mundane tasks that drive us crazy. We were designed to hunt/gather food being surrounded by nature and loved ones constantly.\\n3. Most people's perceptions of hunter gatherer societies are incorrect. Human lifespan was approximately the same length as it is today, we just have a much lower rate of infant mortality. [https://www.livescience.com/10569-human-lifespans-constant-2-000-years.html](https://www.livescience.com/10569-human-lifespans-constant-2-000-years.html) Also the idea they were constantly working and constantly starving is not true. Modern day hunter gatherers live a life of leisure and relative abundance of food. They only work a few hours per day.\\n4. Ignorance is bliss. Today we are constantly wracked with existential fear about the eternal void that awaits us when we die. Before science and technology people were certain that eternal bliss awaited them after death or that they would reincarnate as another person.\\n5. Modern medicine interferes with natural selection. Before if you had a life threatening illness you'd die a quick death and never reproduce. Today most people reproduce regardless of their genetic fitness. They give birth to children who suffer with life-long illnesses, I know from personal experience of dealing with several illnesses I've had for years.\\n\\nI have several other reason but I'll end it here.

Lastly, one thing I like more about Naruto than Dragon ball is that Naruto starts off as a kid that is in the lowest position he can be in, not strong at all, no support from anyone, but you see as he slowly gains those things throughout the show, which is what makes it a near-perfect bildungsroman.

While you can enjoy the company of one person for a large period of time, over time it\\'s possible that they will get tired of you. This is especially true if your personality is such that you can\\'t make any other friends than that one person. What makes a \"one friend\" relationship toxic is the implication that that friend owes it to you to put you on this pedestal above all else, because you\\'ve done the same to this person. Owing time and effort to another person is not what a friendship should be, that\\'s a business transaction. A friendship should be an overall enjoyment of the other person\\'s company and should consist of putting time and effort into that person because you want to, not because you feel like you have to repay that person. \\n\\nI understand that introverts have a difficult time making new friends and getting out of their comfort zone. In fact, I don\\'t think having only one friend is necessarily toxic as long as your friendship consists of mutual acknowledgement that neither friend owes the other any of their time and effort and instead give the other as much time and effort as they feel comfortable with giving. This means that if the time and effort they want to put into you changes over time, you have to accept that. To clarify, I\\'m not saying that if someone says they\\'re your best friend one day and the next refuses to acknowledge you in front of their other friends that they\\'re not a toxic person.

       " 'I see a lot of times when adults or older teens are made fun of for liking things like children shows or games ranging from My Little Pony to Fortnite, and it just seems unnecessary, because there are actual aspects of these things that make them enjoyable.\\n\\nSure, the target audience is younger people, but there is no doubt you will grab some older people. Looking alittle broader, there are people who genuinely enjoy aninsted shows on Cartoon Network or Disney channels, andit totally makes sense when there is reason given. Some of these shows have well developed characters, a thought out story line filled with plenty of tension, and the animation aspect could be really well done. This can go down to My Little Pony, seeing just how many episodes there are, and how it actually has an audience. I personally don\\'t enjoy it, but others do and that is okay.\\n\\nVideo game wise, it gets a little harder to decide, because when you think of games made for kids, you think of those colorful, simplistic \"games\" you see little kids play on ipads or computers. But things as old as pokemon to as new as fortnite have aspects that actually make them enjoyable, despite being very child-based and cartoonish. There\\'s a reason fortnite is currently huge, and why minecraft is still at the top as well. You cant let the child base distract you. It\\'s all a matter of taste.\\n\\nFinally, i want to focus more on the misintention of the audience acrosd these games and shows. Fortnite was originally intended for older player bases but grabbed attention from kids quickly. This could be said about a lot of things, like the Call of Duty franchise, and plenty of shows on Adult Swim. Same goes for the other way around. One of the biggest reasons this came to mind is from Spongebob, being a show meant to attract children, but continuing to grab a wider audience of (young) adults today. This may be because these adults enjoy the nostalgia of the show, but other shows like Regular Show, Gravity Falls, and Adventure Time did really well at reaching out to older people, while still retaining a younger feel. (These were all amazing shows. RIP to each).\\n\\nThats about it. If you want more proof of the adult audience existing for younger shows, just look up \"[Show/Game] Review\" on youtube. Youll be surprised at how many 7k subscriber channels there are that are based solely on these shows.',\n",

Hell, just saying you're gonna do it will get you locked up, as if you were threatening to harm someone else. Your *own* life should be yours to throw away as you please. \\n\\nNow I'll talk about the practical logistics of suicide which make it difficult in a concrete sense. Suicide, physically, is a difficult task as it involves overcoming a survival instinct  that natural selection has honed since the first primitive life emerged from protoplasmic slime. Secondly, life is fairly hardy, humans can survive some pretty crazy shit. Look up Phineas Gague.  That will reinforce this point more than I can with any rhetoric in my arsenal. But in short he survived a steel rod passing directly through his brain. This toughness of the human body can make it hard to find reliable methods that will kill us outright and as a result many methods are long and drawn out or horrendously messy or brutal. The reason we must resort to these brutal methods is because of the social taboo aspect of suicide I mentioned in my first paragraph.\\n\\nNow I will briefly address why suicide is not cowardly or easy in a moral and psychological sense. Deciding to kill yourself is decided to voluntarily face the most daunting and frightening unknown that stalks us all every day of our lives like an unseen shadow: death. You knowingly say good bye to your friends and family for the time, you see your own death looming like a spectre but you push on regardless. Knowingly going to your own death is considered a noble act under other circumstances. \\n\\nIn the spirit of I intellectual honesty I will label this as the crux of my argument and it's basis rests on a foundation derived in large part from opinion. It is my inalienable belief that it is better to die on your feet to live on your knees in that it's better to die than to live a pathetic pointless life that you resent and struggle to bear. The universe and society should not bully you into living a life you don't want.\\n\\nI'm sure this topic has been covered here before to a large extent, but I hope I brought some novel ideas to the discussion.

Before calling me a shill, please read my post.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWith history and politics classes learned in China and my exposure towards western opinions about the Tibet issue in mind, I have always wondered: why do people idolize Dalai Lama?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI mean, China has done quite a bunch of shitty things, such as the \"Re-education camps\" for the Uighur Muslim people, and is by default a bad guy in the western standpoint. Time after time, China has been mentioned directly and vocally as an enemy of the United States during the presidential inaugural speeches. Naturally, Dalai Lama, being an exile and enemy of China, has been deemed as a freedom fighter.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHowever, that is not the aspect of Dalai I want to talk about. It is that people look towards him as some kind of saint, to look for spiritual guidance and such. Has he performed any miracles that I did not know about? I mean, look at the way Dalai Lama\\'s are \"reincarnated\": the last Panchen Lama points to a vague direction after the last Dalai Lama died, and monks go to search for a newborn baby with the traits Panchen mentioned. (Please correct me if my memory serves me wrong.) Duh! With the sheer population of China, there is no question you would find newborns that fit the bill. It is a simple matter of probability! And keep in mind that this reincarnation tradition did not start after the fifth Panchen. What? Those holier-than-thou did not know they were reincarnating before? I would say that China appointing the next Dalai Lama is on the same level as the \"traditional\" way in term of ridiculousness.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow we have this guy, who was chosen by a ridiculous ritual, to become the religion and political leader of a whole region, and now he has become a spiritual guru. I am not the only one to find it laughable, am I? I mean, sure, he would be wise, given his life experiences throughout all these years because he is old now. But would he be wiser than an old person of the same age? Would he be much wiser that he is pretty much a God among us whereas the other old guy is just a guy?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI think I have seen an episode of John Oliver on this topic. They interview random people on the street what they know about Dalai Lama: they think he is a spiritual leader but they don\\'t know why.

       " 'I don\\'t think the best way to solve poverty is with a UBI or raised wages.\\n\\nThe USA is already in trillions of dollars of debt. We don\\'t need to start taxing the shit out of everything just to have a UBI. All that will do is force thousands of companies to go bankrupt and put the USA in even further debt and price inflation. People are only part of the \"Yang Gang\" because no one sees the downside of it, they only want the NEETbux. People will start flooding the USA and abusing that system if that happens, we don\\'t need anyone else moving here by this point, there\\'s too many people here already, nor do we need to be put even further into debt.\\n\\nAnd as rich as companies are, they cannot afford to keep putting up with the minimum wage. You may ask \"Why can\\'t a company such as Target or Domino\\'s Pizza afford to raise its wages?\" it\\'s because they already pay their employees worldwide 100s of millions of dollars a week. They need to make some kind of a profit to stay in business and pay off the money they owe. This is why many major companies are raising prices and why something that cost 15 cents back in the 50s is $3.00 now, they need to keep up with their wages by raising their prices.\\n\\nInstead, we should just make everything cheaper. Not \"1950s cheap\" but 1980s/1990s cheap. I know there was a bit of a price inflation in the late 80s, but it was no where near as bad as inflation today, not even in \"80s bucks\" Everything from rents to food to services, people may even become more wealthy and be able to buy more stuff and be able to live off a normal wage again. It might hurt certain companies or certain people financially when it starts but everyone would be able to recover pretty quickly, and the outcome may definitely help both consumers and companies themselves over time.\\n\\nI can definitely see why a UBI or Increased wages would appeal to people, but I think people don\\'t see/ignore the downside to them.\\n\\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.',\n",
       " \"So to start off here I've been a very avid gamer for the past 30 years. After playing my first Atari game I was hooked. I'd play anything on any platform. So while I mostly play consoles out of convenience (I own all 3), I do also game on PC as well. Basically I'll play where the games are.\\n\\nNext piece is that I do understand that not all mods are the same. Mods to make a game run better or look better are totally fine by me. That all makes sense. A dev house screws up and their game doesn't play well and a fan fixes it? Amazing.\\n\\nNow my main thoughts. Video games are far better without mods. This is the developers true vision for their game and that should be what we all want most. Why do we as gamers think changing things will make it better? It's weird to me that people would go in and mod a game to their liking. If you want something different then why wouldn't you just go in and make the game you want?\\n\\nWhile I admit that seeing Thomas the Tank Engine and Macho Man dragons in Skyrim is hilarious, why would you ever want to play a full game like that? The other weird shit? Nude mods. Like WTF? It takes like not even a week for nude mods on games to drop now. People seriously can't play games without make believe people being naked in the game?\\n\\nFull brand new campaigns in games as well? Again, why waste time on this when you could use those talents and time on making your own game?\\n\\nI guess I just don't get it. I'm not a creative person in the least, so when I get a game from someone or some place full of creatives, I just enjoy what has been given to me instead of trying to figure out how to make it better or more to my liking.\\n\\nI know in I'm the minority on this, but I felt the need to express this unpopular opinion.\",\n",

       " 'I know that most people my age (Gen Z) are going to agree with this, but most older generations will not so I count it as an unpopular opinion.\\n\\nMany kids and adults alike find video games and especially violent video games like Call of Duty and other shooters very fun. For me, it\\'s a way that I can connect with my friends and do something with them outside of school that\\'s really easy and convenient for everyone. We play games like Rainbow Six: Siege which involves a lot of violence (because that\\'s what the game\\'s built off of). \\n\\nNever once have I, after a long playing session, or one of my friends (pretty sure) thought that it would be a good idea to just hurt someone physically. Even when I get mad at the game because of some stupid mechanic or bug or because I\\'m just bad, I don\\'t have an urge to hurt anyone, and I know exactly why. I can, like most people, know the difference between the game and reality. \\n\\nIn games like Rainbow Six: Siege, you are rewarded for killing enemies in the form of points and a kill on the leaderboard. I don\\'t look at someone and go, \"Hey, if I killed that dude I\\'d be up 120 points and I\\'d have a kill.\" That just doesn\\'t happen.\\n\\nIf a kid has a mental health problem where either they can\\'t separate the game from reality or are psychologically addicted to the game, they might lash out or inflict physical harm. However, this is not caused by the game. This is caused by their mental health problem and because their parent allowed them to play the game. Most graphically violent video games have an M rating which means that you have to be 18 or older to purchase the game. If you don\\'t want your kid playing a game... Don\\'t buy it??? Or don\\'t allow your kid to play it???? \\n\\nLook, correlation does not equal causation. Just because your child played Fortnite and the next day shot up a school doesn\\'t mean that it was because of the game. There are way too many factors to make that conclusion. More than likely, the child has a mental health problem that you obviously didn\\'t properly address. If this kid has severe enough (let\\'s just give an example of:) schizophrenia that they commit an act of violence, you should have seen the signs much much sooner because there are definitely warning signs with most if not all mental health disorders. You should have gotten your kid help. \\n\\nNow, of course there are situations beyond parental control. This is in no way blaming all problems like this on parents. I love my parents and I could not be anywhere without them. However, in a situation beyond your control you NEED to reach out. For the safety of you, your child, and everyone else around you, please get your kids help even if they don\\'t think they need it. If your kid is obviously depressed, they likely won\\'t tell you that they need a therapist. I get that some parents don\\'t have the time to pay extremely close attention to their kid, but even if it\\'s just a hunch, you can never be too safe. \\n\\nAnyway to wrap things up, kids need a strong authority figure in the household. If you bend to their will or just don\\'t take care of them and yourself, you are not setting them up for success. Video games is a fantastic way to relieve stress and connect with friends, but they can be bad because they do consume time. Kids need to be able to set aside time where they do their schoolwork and do physical activities other than just electronic ones. It\\'s important that parents build time management into their kids. For me, I\\'m only allowed to play video games on the weekends and breaks. This makes it so that I do all of my school work, instrument practice, and sports during the week so that I have time to do games on the weekends. It makes me more aware of my time and makes it so that I\\'m forced to do other things than just game. \\n\\nOh, and I know this is off topic, but one last thing. If your kid has a weird hobby, please don\\'t ridicule it. I like roleplaying, myself (not the sexual stuff but just telling a story) and it\\'s not a hugely popular hobby. I don\\'t tell my friends about it and I don\\'t tell many people at all about because to be honest I\\'m kind of ashamed of it. I know I shouldn\\'t be, but it\\'s been engraved in my mind that roleplaying is a \"weird hobby\" and isn\\'t \"normal.\" As a teenage boy, it\\'s kind of the goal to be \"normal\" and fit in. However, if the parent allows the kid to freely do their hobby without ridicule and judgement, the kid will grow up thinking that while it\\'s different, it\\'s no stranger than other peoples\\' hobbies. (This is all assuming that the hobby/activity is harmless both physically and emotionally. I do not condone bullying, harassment or any like behavior regardless of whether it makes the perpetrator feel good about themselves.)\\n\\nSTOP TRYING TO MAKE YOUR KID \"NORMAL\" AND INSTEAD ALLOW THEM TO BE CREATIVE AND FREE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES.\\n\\n(Edit) This is my first post here, so if you have any suggestions on how to make my argument stronger I would live to hear them.',\n",

Genetically, I am literally the ONLY male in my family to suffer from hairloss on BOTH SIDES.

Hair loss, especially when you\\'re young, forces you to grow up. Have you ever seen a 30 year old with a full head of hair skateboarding and looked back twice ?

       " 'Everyone obsesses over the fact that people over 18 are voting for the future of people that are under 18, and that’s understandable. However, the way I see it, lowering the legal voting age would be detrimental to society. The youth would be diverting their attention from exams and school in order to display an opinion that often changes in the near future. People under the legal adult age are also more susceptible to give in to peer pressure, and vote with who their friends and family would vote for and are more likely to believe lies.\\n\\nNow why it should be raised.\\n\\nIn most democratic countries where the legal voting age is 18, the demographic of people of ages between 18-21 show the lowest turnout. This was the case in the 2016 US Presidential Elections, the 2017 French Presidential Elections and, most notably, the 2016 Brexit Referendum, where the turnout of voters between ages 18-24 was less than 40%. The majority of the ones that had voted wanted to remain in the EU, so had all 18-24 year olds voted in the same trend, the UK would not have to leave the EU as the balance would’ve been tipped the other way. The general low turnout of people just over 18 shows that young adults don’t value the vote, especially as much as the retired population, who show consistently high turnouts. Therefore, the legal voting age should not at all be lowered, and, in fact, should be raised.',\n",

Storms form due to water buildup in clouds then the water comes down, and winds come from pressure difference in the atmosphere due to temperature differences, etc. Tsunamis form from earthquakes or volcanic eruptions that push the water in such ways, and the sun and moon rise because of the rotation of earth and the revolution of the moon around the earth.

       " '\\n\\nThe birth rates in our country are falling steadily. Fewer and fewer women are electing to bear children for plenty of legitimate reasons, many of which are based in finances. Women are now expected to work full time, provide for themselves, all while bearing and rearing children, and this is an incredibly difficult task for anyone to accomplish. I think feminism is wonderful, but the affect that feminism has had on the birth rate is what is troubling, as more and more women elect to pursue careers rather than bear children, this creates a problem for the sustainability of the nation.\\n\\nThe problem is that the country needs children if we are going to continue to operate as we do, as a world power politically, economically, and militarily. Despite any arguments of \"children are bad for the environment\", the world will continue to have children regardless of anything. The argument defeats itself, as in order to \"save the environment\" we must have the power to do so, and without a very significant population that legitimizes our economic, political, and military  power, any ability to save the environment will disappear with our own power.\\n\\nBeing a mother should be treated like a job, because despite the modern disapproval of \"gender roles\" or the life of a \"homemaker\", being a mother is the original and distinguishing \\'job\\' of all female animals, from birds and snakes to everything with biological sexes. Clearly it is a job, and even if it is not directly part of the economy in terms of buying and selling, motherhood is the crude oil that the economy refines and burns in order to continue to function. Motherhood should easily be respected as much as any other career, and bearing children should be funded to the point of being a possible career, provided the children are taken care of.\\n\\nMany countries like France compensate women per child, and at this point, bearing children can become just as much of a ‘mom and pop shop’, as any other, and due to functioning as an economy of scale, meaning running a business becomes cheaper and more cost effective when the business is larger scale, there is a point where bearing more children becomes profitable for the mother, in the same sense that the children are a valuable and vital resource for our country.\\n\\nThe amount of money that a person with college degree can benefit the economy and thus the country is significant when compared to the value of an uneducated person, but this small bonus cannot compare in the slightest to what 3 or 4 extra laborers would add into the economy over the course of their lives, especially when that college educated person may have taken a professional job and is career focused, thus may elect to only have one or even no children. This means that the children yield at an exponential and unlimited rate over time, while the college degree yields at a flat rate that eventually terminates after a set period of time.\\n\\nI am not criticizing these women, but it is imperative that humans in this country reproduce. \\n\\nThe more women there are who choose not to reproduce means that the remaining women who do reproduce must reproduce at a rate above replacement in order to replace the women and men who chose not to reproduce. When these women are now expected to bear even more children simply so others can work, this makes their job as mothers even more challenging and expensive than it was to simply reproduce at replacement, let alone still manage to keep up with their own jobs that pay money that enables them to be mothers in the first place.\\n\\nAllowing women to be pseudo-employed, or even fully employed, by the state as mothers through socialism is exponentially more so beneficial to the country than giving people free college. Beyond this, many of these women and their children currently need financial help because raising children is even more expensive than going to college, thus these women are equally in need of assistance regardless of any of these points. But still, the point is that bearing children far more beneficial to the country than educating a select number people and any reasonable projection that extends beyond 30 or 50 years would clearly show just how massive of a difference there is.\\n\\nIf you cannot sympathize with the dwindling birth rate, with the economy, the country as a whole, or even the fate of the free world, fine. Regardless of this, at least sympathize with the mothers attempting to raise children in poverty, who are constantly struggling and suffering from the abuse of a society that expects women to do the often impossible task of working enough to provide for themselves all while bearing and rearing children.\\n\\nWhen these women and their children are suffering in inescapable poverty, all while sacrificing the majority of their lives in order to provide society with the most significant and valuable resource our country has, the least they deserve is fair compensation for their devotion and service to the country.',\n",

Westworld is philosophical and extremely clever with its social commentary on Capitalism, Human Nature and the advancing future of technology, while also being a SciFi- Western Thriller. GoT is extremely political and the fight scenes are excruciatingly slow and hard to watch. Though there have been good twists, most every season is just people plotting wars. It gets tiring. Westworld begins seasons disorientated and confusing but slowly works itself out, which leads to a satisfying conclusion, while GoT begins and ends with more boring conspiracies and battles.

No, not when I have a dishwasher.\\n\\nSo I typically take clean dishes out of the dishwasher as I need them, and if my sink gets full I will fill the dishwasher up and run it with whatever remaining dishes/silverware are still in there.\\n\\nAlso humble brag I'm in the top 1% of energy efficiency vs. my neighbors, and I take pride in that and my dishwasher does too.\",\n",
       " 'Most people honestly don\\'t give a fuck. It usually makes them uncomfortable if they haven\\'t experienced it themselves. Talking about it brings everyone down even if they understand and empathise completely. \\n\\nWhy do you think there are so many posts here about \"too many people claiming to be depressed nowadays\"? More people ARE depressed and the rising suicide rates show it, but it still makes everyone uncomfortable when someone complains about it to them. Maybe its more comforting to think they\\'re just faking for attention. I don\\'t know.\\n\\nAs someone with several diagnosed mental illnesses, I sure as fuck don\\'t want to hear about someone elses strugges or talk about my own. Instead of thinking \"wow I\\'m not alone after all\" my mind just goes to \"that sucks and there\\'s nothing either of us can do about it\".\\n\\nThe worst of all was back in high school when some nerdy kid barely anyone knew committed suicide. Then suddenly every popular kid who bullied them is now their best friend who is completely devistated by their loss for a week until everyone forgets about it.\\n\\nSame with celebrities.

Then of course everyone forgets in a week and we\\'re all back to not giving a fuck.\\n\\nWith medication and therapists and shit I can\\'t help but think we\\'re at the point now with mental health where we were 100+ years ago with physical health.
